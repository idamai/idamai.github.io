				<h1>Iggy</h1>
				<p>Born on August 3rd, 1992 to Winoto Hadimartojo and Indriana Martha, Ignatius Damai is an avid singer, actor, photographer and developer. 
				He is currently pursuing his undergradate degree from the National University of Singapore. He went for the NUS Overseas College scholarship 
				program in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania to hone his entrepreneurial skills. He picked up his photography skills in the land of freedom with 
				his newly bought Nikon D3300, paid with his own sweat and blood. Now, he wants to show the world that there is no need to travel very far just to 
				make donations or help those who are in need. There are people who are in need right next to us. It is only a matter of opening our eyes to notice it, or simply ignore it.
